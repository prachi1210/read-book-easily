# Read Book Easily
This is a simple PHP based web-app to easily read books available online without clicking the next button over and again.

I built this when I ran across several sites such as [BookRix](http://www.bookrix.com/), [Library of Congress](http://www.read.gov/)  which offered online reading but through the cumbersome process of pressing the next buttons.
